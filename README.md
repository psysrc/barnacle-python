# barnacle
An experimental interpreted programming language written in Python.

Aptly named because barnacles don't do a lot, are rough around the edges, and will cause you pain if you work with them too much.

A similar GitHub project exists, [barnacle-rust](https://github.com/psysrc/barnacle-rust), which is intended to become an implementation of **barnacle** written in Rust.
The Python implementation of **barnacle** is intended mostly for experimentation.

## Future Development Roadmap
- v0.1: Tokenizer experimentation
- v0.2: Parser experimentation
- v0.3: Interpreter experimentation
- v???: ???
